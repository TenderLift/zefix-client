# Changelog

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Add UID utilities as zero-dependency submodule

  **BREAKING CHANGE:** UID functions are no longer exported from the main package. They are now available as a separate lightweight submodule.

  ### Migration:

  ```typescript
  // Old (no longer works):
  import { formatUid, normalizeUid } from "@tenderlift/zefix-client";

  // New:
  import { formatUid, normalizeUid } from "@tenderlift/zefix-client/uid";
  ```

  ### Features:
  - New zero-dependency UID submodule (~1KB minified)
  - Pure functions with TypeScript branded types for type safety
  - Flexible input handling (CHE-123.456.789, che 123 456 789, with VAT suffixes)
  - Functions: `normalizeUid`, `formatUid`, `isValidUidFormat`, `uidEquals`
  - Branded type `UidCore` for normalized UIDs

  This change allows users who only need UID utilities to import them without the entire ZEFIX client.
